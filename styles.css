/*
    This CSS file is for any additional custom styles or overrides
    that are not handled by Tailwind CSS directly in the HTML.
    Most of the visual styling for the layout, spacing, colors, etc.,
    is applied using Tailwind classes in the HTML.
*/

/* Example: You can define custom fonts here if you prefer not to import in HTML head directly */
/* @import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Inter:wght@300;400;600;700&display=swap'); */

/*
    Basic body styles are already in the HTML's <style> tag to ensure they load quickly.
    You can add more specific overrides here if needed.
*/

/*
    Example of a custom style you might add:
    .profile-card:hover {
        box-shadow: 0 10px 20px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15);
    }
    Note: A similar effect is already applied using Tailwind's 'shadow-xl' and 'hover:scale-105'
    for transformation, so this is just an illustrative example of what could go here.
